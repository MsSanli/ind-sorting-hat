You MAY use the renderToDom() function that we worked on in class, but you also need to be able to explain it if you use it
You have to create a data structure for your project. Review all the elements that need to be on the DOM and create the structure accordingly




TO DO #4 FUNCTION TO RENDER CARDS TO DOM THAT TAKES AN ARRAY ???????
make sure its in a container b/c it looks like its in a separate "box" 
  use bootstrap card to determine the format
  create DOMSTRING SO WE CAN PUSH CARDS TO IT
  Use FOR EACH LOOP TO LOOP OVER ARRAY AND CREATE STUDENT CARDS
  SET DOMSTRING TO CARD CONTAINER 

  DO I NEED THIS CODE AFTER? 
const app = document.querySelector("#app");
  //NOW SET CARDS TO OUR APP DIVS INNER HTML**********
  app.innerHTML = domString;
};

  LAST STEP RENDERTODOM(STUDENTS)
TO DO #5 Make FORM - use bootstrap form 

TO DO #6 MAKE BUTTONS - 5 BUTTONS
TO DO #7 


- A [bootstrap form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/) will then appear to fill in the student's name and a button to sort. This should then assign the student to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin). 

- On sorting a student, the form should clear and a [bootstrap card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) with the student's name and a random house assignment should print below the form. 


## Expel Button Hints
Think of a way you can expel students without just hiding those divs on the page. This would mean when the button is clicked you modify the array of students and pass the new array into your `renderToDom()` function.  Double hint - put a unique id in the student object when you create them.






TO DO #3 Your JS file should be comprised of functions, no actions should happen in your code outside of a function except for your initial init() function
TO DO #4 Helpful Form: An error message shows if a user tries to sort a student without filling out the form
You should apply responsive design to your page (aka your app should be designed to work on small screens)
Your HTML and JS should all have proper indentation
